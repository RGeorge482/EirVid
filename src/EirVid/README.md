# EirVid - Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD) Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains the collaborative work for our Object-Oriented Analysis & Design (OOAD) course project. 
The project focuses on developing a prototype for the EirVid software system, an e-services solution. 
This document outlines the group requirements, individual responsibilities, and our approach to software development, including planning, design, and implementation.

### Group Report
Our group report reflects the collective effort in planning and prototyping the EirVid system. Key components include:
- **Problem Definition:** Detailed description of the EirVid system and the problems it aims to solve.
- **Requirements:** A comprehensive list of system requirements.
- **UML Diagrams:** Utilization of UML diagrams to visually represent system components.
- **Use Case Scenarios:** Includes both successful and failure scenarios.
- **User Story:** Outlines a user interaction feature for future implementation.
- **Software Development Methodologies:** Description of methodologies used by the team.

### Algorithms, Architecture & Design Patterns (AADP)
- **NetBeans Project:** A working prototype demonstrating the proposed solution.
- **Class File Ownership:** Each class file is attributed to a single team member, with comments indicating their name and student number.
- **GitHub Tracking:** Use of GitHub for version control and tracking changes.
- **Design Implementation:** Employment of abstract classes, interfaces, appropriate algorithms, architecture, and design patterns.
